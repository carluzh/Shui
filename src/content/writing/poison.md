      I‚Äôve found myself contemplating whether or not to lock up tokens numerous times.

      Having made both good and bad experiences, I created a simple mental model that increased my hit rate and gains.

      Pretty much every protocol under the sun has implemented some form of the locking mechanism.
    </div>
    <div class="tweet-content">
      This helps in supporting price action as a share of tokens leaves the market for a long time/forever.

      The rewards enticing users to lock can take various forms, some of which I‚Äôll list here:
    </div>
    <div class="tweet-content">
      ‚Ä¢ Profit share: value accrual through protocol revenue
    </div>
    <div class="tweet-content">
      ‚Ä¢ Voting power: direct token emissions flow and earn bribes

      ‚Ä¢ Staking pool: earn protocol-native emissions (unsustainable on its own)
    </div>
    <div class="tweet-content">
      These are the main ones out of which protocols mix and match a unique reward mechanism.

      The rewards scale exponentially with the lock duration and the locking can take the form of single-side or LP locking.

      Here‚Äôs a great thread from @0xWives on the benefits of an 80/20 locking mechanism.

      Users can supply $BAL / $ETH in an 80/20 pool, increasing liquidity and lock the LP tokens to receive veBAL.
    </div>
    <div class="tweet-content">
      veBAL holders get boosted yields (up to 2.5x), voting power to direct liquidity mining emissions (possibility for bribes) and revenue share of the protocol.

      So far so good. But I‚Äôm not a dev or DAO member interested in incentivising stakeholders, securing liquidity or increasing TVL and presumably, neither are you...

    <div class="tweet-content">
      How can I use these tools to my advantage then?
    </div>
    <div class="tweet-content">
      Just lock your tokens.

      1. Often times the APR/APY promised by a protocol is eroded through price depreciation over the locked period.
    </div>
    <div class="tweet-content">
      Locking is a great tool to either earn additional yield (f.e. stables) with ‚Äúrisk-on‚Äù capital but it should never be the sole focus of the investment.

      It can be attractive to lock a position for 4 years because the payback period is only 100 days.

      However, this doesn‚Äôt take dilution, revenue fluctuation or other systemic/protocol risks into account.

      You lock up $10k, get back $5k over the course of 3 months and then the protocol gets exploited/rugs/narrative shifts etc.

      Not only did you lose $5k but on top of that the profit, you could have made if you just farmed stables or bought another coin.

      3. "Your size is not size"

    <div class="tweet-content">
      It makes sense to enter concentrated big bets. But are you comfortable locking up 10% of your portfolio for a year?
    </div>
    <div class="tweet-content">
      What if your position grows 100x and your net worth is perfectly correlated to the protocol's token (tbf that‚Äôs a good problem to have)?

      So are you better of providing liquidity for a token/stable pair? Not necessarily.

      Locking makes it impossible to sell a position if you have a short-term need for capital or FUD gets to you.

      It‚Äôs a simple set and forget strategy that forces you to hold until the very end.

      So which projects should you lock and which are better thought of as quick flips?

      There‚Äôs a model you probably have heard of already that illustrates my thought process perfectly.

      My conclusion:

    <div class="tweet-content">
      Locking is a great tool to compound or de-risk high confidence bets but should only be seen as such and not as an opportunity to build ‚Äúperpetual passive income for generations‚Äù.

      I'll quickly go over 2 personal lessons where locking has/would have made a huge impact.

      After buying with 5% of my portfolio I locked the tokens and started earning yield.

      This position is now at a rough 4x and I‚Äôm confident it‚Äôll grow more.

      Deus had been on my radar for a long time. I was introduced to the project through a friend even before it had launched.

      As there was no locking mechanism at the time I just held it in my wallet as it grew.

    <div class="tweet-content">
      At a 2x I decided to exit a chunk of my position and missed out on huge gains even though I was super bullish on the project.
